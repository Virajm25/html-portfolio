<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Viraj Mehrotra, a final-year BCA-AIML student at UPES University, India, with a strong passion for Full Stack Web Development. 
  Although I was not very confident in coding at first, I have been actively working on improving my skills in Java, Python, SQL, and 
  Data Science fundamentals. To strengthen my foundation, I am practicing on platforms like HackerRank and working on various projects 
  that help me develop problem-solving abilities. My goal is to build real-world applications that not only enhance my knowledge but 
  also showcase my capabilities.</p>

<p>During my academic journey, I completed an internship at Gram Praudyogik Vikas Sansthan, where I worked on developing an attendance 
  system using Python and Machine Learning. Currently, I am working on a Machine Learning project titled Early Diagnosis of Diabetes 
  Using ML, using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and ANN. Alongside this, I am building a Data Analytics portfolio
  on GitHub with projects like a Sales Performance Dashboard and Customer Segmentation using SQL and Python. I want to make my projects 
  visually appealing and insightful, ensuring they add value to my learning and career prospects.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I plan to pursue an online MCA while dedicating my full time to becoming a skilled Full Stack Web Developer. I am 
  aiming for a remote job that allows me to continue upskilling while gaining industry experience. My long-term goal is to establish a 
  strong career in tech and make my parents proud of my achievements. With a disciplined approach to learning and a mindset focused on 
  continuous improvement, I am determined to succeed and build a future in software development.</p>
